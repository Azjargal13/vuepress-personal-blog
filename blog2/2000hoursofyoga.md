Yeey! :sparkles:

Today I have reached the milestone of doing Yoga for 2000 hours.

This journey began end of April (Apr/28), since increasing number of covid-19 positive cases in Japan, Tokyo had declared the 'state of emergency' at that time and my work was totally done remotely.

As the physical movement reduced during WFH activity, I wanted to do easy workout which helps to move my body. I have done Yoga practice earlier in Mongolia and in India, so I know that I like yoga a lot, it helps to stay calm and improves overall body strength, flexibility.

I do yoga twice a day, morning and evening. Morning exercise usually takes about 17-18 minutes, depend on the exercise that I select. Mostly I do 'morning body refreshing exercises' which relaxes neck and back, prepares my body to energize and perform well on a day ahead. Evening exercise takes about 18-20 minutes, more resting my body and relaxing neck and back for whole day sitting. Also, it prepares my body to cool down and sleep better.

I've completed 2000 hours of Yoga practice in 50 days. From end of April til 12th of July, in between (whole June) I did not do yoga, because I was trying different kind of exercises including walking, jogging, running and other hyper energytic exercises. This trial helped me to understand what kind of exercises that my body likes to do and probably give a motivation to continue the exercise everyday without tiredness and procrastination. 

It turns out, I realized that my body likes exercises which takes less energy, speed and physical strength (power), kind of soft exercises such as walking and yoga. These exercises help not only my body to move also it makes my mind calm and way relaxed.

I will be keep doing yoga further, also keep exploring other softer exercises to try out and update my milestone sooner.
