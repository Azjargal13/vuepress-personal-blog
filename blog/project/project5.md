## Inspiration

There had a time where I just wanted to try something interesting & new, related to static site generators, so I've picked up Hexo as it is powerful and popular among the developers.

This give me good foundation knowledge of how static site generators are work and how the project need to be structured.

I was able to link to template of the theme in the project, that was pretty good learning for better usage of Github.

Although in this project I've used already prepared template, which later give me big inspiration to build own personalized theme.

In this blog, I've written numerous articles more on competitive coding and techy topics.

## Frameworks & Tools

- Hexo, the simple & powerful blog framework
- Chic, theme template for the blog
- Github Pages (for initial deployment)
- Netlify (later/constant deployment)

It is live on <https://azjargal.netlify.com/>
