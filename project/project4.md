## Inspiration

This is one of the earlier projects I have developed with an intension to learn and understand VuePress better.

NewsAPI is used to fetch the latest, trend news and to represent in the application.

I have wanted to give higher (full) authority to users to select which type of news should be available in their feed news. <br>
User can select type of news, agent, geo location etc to get updated to latest trend news around the world.
