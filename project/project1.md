## [ByteAcads](https://www.byteacads.com/)

Landing page development for EdTech startup, ByteAcads.com. 

I have huge interest on education technology which helps massive amounts of students who like to gain knowledge from available resources as such online lessons. The idea always inspires me as I like to study online too, which later directed me to do something related with EdTech, so first I've started developing initial phase for ByteAcads.com.

### Framework & Tools

VueJs is personal favorite framework, so it is also used in this project. 
For design, TailwindCss is used, cute icons and characters are from unDraw.
